## Current Focus

hypothesis: The isolated per-project MIX_BUILD_PATH and dependency compilation path disagree about where JOSE's generated include files live; launcher ownership and compile-time PORT may also prevent readiness.
test: Reproduce the dependency compilation failure, then prove isolated database setup and HTTP readiness without invoking Playwright.
expecting: The original runner fails before HTTP readiness; repaired setup starts each scoped app at its configured port and shuts down cleanly.
next_action: gather initial evidence from the runner source and retained setup logs

## Symptoms

expected: The isolated runner restores locked dependencies, creates a fresh project database, starts the real Phoenix app, and reaches HTTP readiness before running the selected registration test.
actual: Setup fails before the app is HTTP-ready. All three registration projects remain not_run and browser invocations remain zero.
errors: The final allowed infrastructure retry failed during dependency compilation because the per-project Mix build path omitted a JOSE include artifact. Earlier attempts hit read-only Hex cache, a closed output pipe, and lost launcher ownership/shared compilation for another port.
timeline: Phase 253 Plan 02 execution on 2026-10-13; retained summary records the one infrastructure retry as exhausted.
reproduction: scripts/ci/ci-registration-repro.sh --run-frozen using 253-REPRO-FREEZE.json; do not rerun that exhausted freeze. Use a separate bounded setup-only diagnostic with no browser invocation.
source: Symptoms are already established in the preceding session and committed phase records; no missing user report is needed.

## Boundaries

- Repair and verify startup only. Do not reset the original freeze, retry allowance, or terminal evidence. Do not invoke registration browser tests in this debug task.
- A setup-only integration check must have a new explicit record, at most three project launches and twenty minutes total, no automatic retry. Preserve all nonzero results.
- Leave registration acceptance fail closed, CIREL-01/CIREL-02 open, Plans 02/07 halted and 08 blocked until their separate proof work completes.
- Do not change product registration helpers, Playwright selections, retry behavior, lockfiles, required check names, hosted canary records, or Phase 252 paths.
- No GitHub calls or hosted runs are needed for this startup repair.
- Preserve exact dirty planning bytes before replacements, including this session checkpoint. Commit specific paths only; verify read-back before mutation. Initial checkpoint is preserved before delegation.
- Code ownership: scripts/ci/ci-registration-repro.sh and its scoped setup tests/support module; debug-session evidence only under .planning/debug/. Parent owns shared state/handoff and phase summaries.

## Eliminated

None yet.

## Evidence

- timestamp: 2026-10-13T12:16:53Z
  checked: Initial git status and retained registration evidence
  found: Working tree clean at 38a4ecf89424638242e1807900fb8a0b64bc2d43; zero browser runs and exhausted infrastructure retry recorded.
  implication: Repair setup independently; do not classify the historical registration failure from startup results.
