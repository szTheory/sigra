# Phase 248: Code Review Disposition

| Finding | Severity | Disposition | Source |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| CR-01 | critical | fixed | 248-REVIEW-FIX.md |
| CR-02 | critical | open | - |
| CR-03 | critical | fixed | 248-REVIEW-FIX.md |

Dispositions: `open` (recorded, not yet triaged), `fixed`, `skipped`, `deferred`.
Set `deferred` by hand and put the reason in the Source cell; both are preserved. A `|` in the reason is kept as prose and escaped on the next run.
Re-running the gate keeps every row it can. A row the current review no longer reports is kept and its Source cell flagged, so a finding does not leave this record silently. ONE exception: when a finding id is REUSED by a different finding, the earlier decision cannot keep a row — the id is taken — and it is dropped. A RECORDED decision (anything but `open`) is named on the console when that happens; a row still at `open` is replaced silently, because `open` records no decision to lose.
