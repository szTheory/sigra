# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md`

**Core value:** Authentication that works out of the box with great DX on the happy path and on the rough edges.

**Current focus:** v1.35 BRAND-SYSTEM-PRESSURE-TEST is complete after Phase 167 logo ratification.

## Current Position

Phase: 167 — Logo Options + Brand Direction Review
Plan: 167-02 complete
Status: Option A Core Rails ratified and final logo system updated
Last activity: 2026-06-05 — Option A Core Rails selected and finalized across primary logo, mark, monochrome mark, favicon, social card, brand book, and HTML brandbook.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Source material for v1.35 was intentionally repo evidence plus the supplied pressure-test prompt; no external AI-generated brand book was available in the repository.
- Process correction: the original v1.35 closeout was premature because it skipped human logo direction review. Phase 167 repaired that gap and ratified Option A Core Rails.
- Brand artifacts are self-contained under `brandbook/` to avoid churn in runtime code, generated templates, README, HexDocs, or existing docs.
- Asset policy is text/SVG-first: Markdown, HTML, JSON, CSS, and SVG are committed; PNG/PDF/raster exports are generated only for concrete distribution targets.
- The brand concept is "protected core framed by visible host-code rails", mapping directly to Sigra's library-owned security core plus generated host-owned Phoenix code.
- The existing README/launch/security posture remains the voice source of truth: boundary-first, technically exact, low hype.
- `brandbook/tokens.json` and `brandbook/tokens.css` are the brand collateral token source; they do not mutate admin/generated UI tokens by themselves.
- Phase 167 plan 01 generated five logo options and an options review page; Phase 167 plan 02 finalized Option A Core Rails after human selection.
- Human logo decision: Option A Core Rails is the ratified Sigra logo direction.

### Pending Todos

- None.

### Blockers/Concerns
