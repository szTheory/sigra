## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Foundation: Hybrid lib+generator boundary — security-critical code in library dep, customizable UX in generated code
- Foundation: No macro-based schema injection — generated schemas are plain Ecto calling library functions
- Foundation: Opaque database-backed tokens for sessions — no JWT for browser auth
- Foundation: Ecto-only data layer — no adapter abstraction
- Foundation: Behaviours + callbacks at every extensibility point — no macros

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (MFA): Session state machine for `mfa_pending` → `mfa_complete` is complex — draw out state diagram before coding (flagged in research)
- Phase 3 (OAuth): Account linking confirmation flow has security implications — review PITFALLS.md section 7 before implementation
- Phase 1: Multi-database migration generation for MySQL/SQLite — map DDL differences (citext, etc.) before generator is built
