Earlier milestones (v1.33–v1.40) are archived under `milestones/`.

## Next

No active milestone. Run `/gsd-new-milestone` to start the next cycle. Jon's stated direction: refocus on **admin/operator-UI cleanup + feedback** (the deferred UI-01/UI-02 + FEAT-01/02/03 items live in STATE.md "Acknowledged at v1.43 close").
